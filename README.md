TCC CS 142 5555 - Group 4 - Final Project Repository


UPDATE 5/20: JavaFX, while pretty cool in its own right, is too cumbersome for use on this project. While that means we won't get to do the really REALLY cool stuff, we can still use Swing (the system we just learned in class) to do the GUI.

Also, for my part of the project, I will need to consolidate and alter other pieces of code, specifically the main methods that drive the code as it currently stands, which need to be linked to GUI interface options.
